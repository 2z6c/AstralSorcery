Graphical next:

- Telescope GUI (uh...)
- Starlight infuser block model (may hold 1 item on top of it, some 'sort' of pedestal?)
- a gui page for starlight infusion (the recipe is 1 item input -> 1 item output)
- (not thought out yet) a way to display the current 'perk-experience' in the game-overlay.
    (-> perk experience is passively gained while using perks and can be spent to unlock the next perk(s))

Code-Wise next:

- Change mounted telescope to what was discussed...
- Add weak constellations lucerna, horologium(SE), mineralis, bootes
- Add 'random' recipes to infuser
- Add make starlight collection in altars based on noise maps instead of build height or random numbers.
- Add a multiplier of said noise maps to starlight collection via crystals
- [TBA]
- Add a way to obtain the enhanced celestial collector crystals (Tier4)

Brainstorm tasks:

- Think about ways to make the altar crafting less gui based
- (Based/Aligned with the upper) Think about design for Trait-Craft altar
