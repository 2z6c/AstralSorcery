Graphical next:

- Telescope GUI (uh...)
- Starlight infuser block model (may hold 1 item on top of it, some 'sort' of pedestal?)
- a gui page for starlight infusion (the recipe is 1 item input -> 1 item output)
- (not thought out yet) a way to display the current 'perk-experience' in the game-overlay.
    (-> perk experience is passively gained while using perks and can be spent to unlock the next perk(s))

Code-Wise next:

[+] - Change mounted telescope to what was discussed...
[+] - Make player unkillable in camera flight (oups forgot about that.)
[+] - Add weak constellations lucerna, horologium(SE), mineralis, bootes, octans
- Add 'random' recipes to infuser
- Add RetroGen cache and versioning to that to enable version-changing retro-gen without bigger issues.
- Add additional (config-enable/disable) checks for network integrity and safe-fail remove if necessary. (be verbose!)
- Add make starlight collection in altars based on noise maps instead of build height or random numbers.
- Add item that lets you 'see' those noise maps in some way.
- Add a multiplier of said noise maps to starlight collection via crystals
- [TBA]
- Add constellation effect to vicio
- Add a way to obtain the enhanced celestial collector crystals (Tier4)

Brainstorm tasks:

- Think about ways to make the altar crafting less gui based
- (Based/Aligned with the upper) Think about design for Trait-Craft altar
