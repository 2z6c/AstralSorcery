Graphical next:

[+] - Telescope GUI (uh...)
[+] - Starlight infuser block model (may hold 1 item on top of it, some 'sort' of pedestal?)
- Item idea/model for skyWaveResonator
- Alignment charge overlay/bar
[+] - [Maybe] Lightwell model change

Code-Wise next:

[+] - Change mounted telescope to what was discussed...
[+] - Make player unkillable in camera flight (oups forgot about that.)
[+] - Add weak constellations lucerna, horologium(SE), mineralis, bootes, octans
[+] - Add 'random' recipes to infuser
[+] - Add RetroGen cache and versioning to that to enable version-changing retro-gen without bigger issues.
[+] - Add additional (config-enable/disable) checks for network integrity and safe-fail remove if necessary. (be verbose!)
[+] - Add make starlight collection in altars based on noise maps instead of build height or random numbers.
[+] - Add item that lets you 'see' those noise maps in some way.
[+] - Add a multiplier of said noise maps to starlight collection via crystals
[+] - Add a crystal-item representation to the ItemHandle
- [TBA]
- Add a way to obtain the enhanced celestial collector crystals (Tier4)

Brainstorm tasks:

- Think about ways to make the altar crafting less gui based
- (Based/Aligned with the upper) Think about design for Trait-Craft altar
