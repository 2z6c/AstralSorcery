Changes:

- Constellation-Tiers removed
- Split constellations into Major and Minor ones
- Multiple major and multiple minor may show up each day
- Crystal attunement may only happen with Major constellations
- Starlight may only be collected/transmitted/received from major constellations
- Minor constellations may still be used as traits
- Only major constellations provide a ritual pedestal AOE
- Constellation discovery now in telescope-tiers:
    - Hand-Telescope (max. 1 major discoverable during 1 night)
    - Telescope (all major ones that are visible in the night are discoverable)
    - Observatory (all major ones and some minor ones are visible/discoverable)
- Player may attune to 1 major constellation early on
    - the ritual may require the player to 'place' blocks that represent the constellation's stars in a 32x32 field.
    - Depending on the constellation the player may progress through a 'Skyrim-skills'-like perk/buffs/skill system
    - Mainly small buffs/effects that should fit the constellation's meaning
    - The last unlockable buff will be a powerful active ability
    - The unlocking-progression should be loosely tied to the progression in the mod
- In order to see details of a constellation in the book, the player needs to store the constellation papers into the book
    - GUI for that can be opened with shift-right-click with the book
- New book section where you can see your constellation as well as the perk/buff-progression and things
    - Unlocking the next perks/buffs will be in that gui
    - Short description will be given when hovered over it.

Open tasks/questions:
Code & Design-Wise:

- Write up the algorithm that chooses constellations for each night
- Assoicate those constellations with render position informations
- Think about the player-attunement ritual
    - Requires a lot of space 32x32
    - Has no central block (center is in some block corners...)
    - Design & Logic lore-wise
    - Further purposes after 1st use/attunement?
- Select major constellations and their themes
    - If possible think about some where a variety of effects and more general usabilities are possible
    - Try to avoid association of those effects with items
    - Find at least 5 perks/passive buffs for the constellation
    
Graphical-Wise:

- New book section background + maybe book texture? Keep using the one that's also used for 'Knowledge'?
    - 1... uuh... hover image? look up videos/screenshots of skyrim's skill system to see what i mean..
    - Star (idle + active) + Star-Connection (idle + active) textures for those
    - a more special Star (idle + active) texture for the final star that unlocks the ability
